# cssharp-redie

/redie css_redie
/unredie css_unredie

issues:
player still makes sounds (would be nice if anyone knows how to fix that)
player in redie can pickup defuse kit
player in redie cant move when inside a living player (was the same in csgo)
EventPlayerSpawn gives error on server join/map change but doesn't affect gameplay

this plugin is bad and should probably not be usedðŸ’€
